# My Dotfiles

This repository contains my dotfiles. I use a combination of [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) and symlinks to manage and link them to the correct locations.

## Overview

- **.pylintrc**: Configuration file for `pylint`, to customize linting rules and preferences for Python code.
- **.stow-local-ignore**: File to instruct `stow` to ignore specific files or directories during symlink creation.
- **.wezterm.lua**: Configuration file for `wezterm`, a GPU-accelerated terminal emulator, for customizing terminal behavior and appearance.
- **.zshrc**: Configuration file for `zsh` shell, containing aliases, environment variables, and other shell settings.
- **extensions.json**: Defines recommended extensions for Visual Studio Code.
- **keybindings.json**: Specifies custom keyboard shortcuts for Visual Studio Code.
- **ruff.toml**: Configuration file for `ruff`, a fast Python linter and formatter.
- **settings.json**: Contains custom user and workspace settings for Visual Studio Code.
