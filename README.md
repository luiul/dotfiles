# My Dotfiles

This repository contains my dotfiles. I use [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) for managing them. The naming convention for GNU Stow is explained in this video: [GNU Stow Naming Convention](https://youtu.be/NoFiYOqnC4o?si=SlQi1YkUaC4GziYH&t=520).

Use `brew bundle dump --file=brew/Brewfile --force` to keep the Brewfile updated. To restore the Brewfile, use `brew bundle --file=brew/Brewfile`.
